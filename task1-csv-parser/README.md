# Practice 1. Simple words counter

## How to use
Just do `java Main.java [input text] [output csv]` and you will get statistics of your text in format: `word,frequency,frequency`

It'll save it as CSV file.

## Example
If input text looks like this:
```
fiz
baz
fiz
fiz
baz
fiz
fizbaz
```
The ouput will be:
```
fiz,4,57.14%
baz,2,28.57%
fizbaz,1,14.29%

```
